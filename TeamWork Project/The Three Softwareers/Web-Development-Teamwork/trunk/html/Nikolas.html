				<h1>Nikolas</h1>
				<p>Nikolas is very determined and business oriented young man. He is deeply engaged with his work.</p>
				<p>One night not long ago he took his lady to a restaurant for dinner. His lady was a little bit late for she was shopping with her friends all day long. His lady was worried that not beeing on time would have upset him. But Nikolas made no comment on it. Conversation wasn’t flowing, so his lady suggested that theu were somewhere quiet so they could have talk. He agreed, but he didn’t say much. His lady asked him what was wrong. He said, <span>‘Nothing’</span>. She asked Nikolas if it was her fault that he was upset. Nikolas said he wasn’t upset, that it had nothing to do with his lady, and not to worry about it.</p>
				<p>On the way home his lady told him she loved him. Nikolas smiled slightly, and kept driving. He didn't say <span>‘I love you, too.’</span> and his lady felt sad and confused. When they got home, his lady felt as if she had lost him completely - Nikolas just sat there quietly, and watched TV.</p>
				<p>He continued to seem distant and absent. Finally, with silence all around them, his lady decided to go to bed. About 15 minutes later, Nikolas came to bed. But he still was distracted, and his thoughts were somewhere else. He fell asleep. His lady started to cry. She didn’t know what to do. She was almost sure that his thoughts were with someone else.</p>
				<p>...</p>
				<p>All the evening Nikolas couldn't get rid of the thought obsessed his mind: <span>'My HTML is broken, can’t figure out why.'</span></p>

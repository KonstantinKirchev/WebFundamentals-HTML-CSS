			<h1>Bogomos</h1>
			<p>Distinguished in every way - intellect, appearance, bravery, skilover - yet he is tortured by a deep melancholy, the source of which follows. </p>
			<p>Years ago while he was walking along a beach, he found a lamp. He rubed the lamp, and a genie appeared. (Ever heard about Alladin and the lamp? That's how it began...)</p>
			<p><span>“I am the most powerful genie in the world. I can grant you any wish, but only one wish.”</span> - the genie said.</p>
			<p>Bogomos pulled out a map, pointed to it and said, <span>“I’d want peace in the Middle East.”</span></p>
			<p>The genie responded, <span>“Gee, I don’t know. Those people have been fighting for millennia. I can do just about anything, but this is likely beyond my limits.”</span></p>
			<p>Bogomos then said, <span>“Well, I am a programmer, and my programs have lots of users. Please make all my users satisfied with my software and let them ask for sensible changes.”</span></p>
			<p>At which point the genie responded, <span>“Um, let me see that map again.”</span></p>
			<p>Bogomos still dreams about his piece in the Middle East...</p>
